A telegraphic transfer (TT) is an electronic method of transferring funds utilized primarily for overseas wire transactions. This is a simple python program that displays a menu of the following options:
- Input a new list of prices
- Print the current prices
- Find the latest price
- Find the average price
- Find the standard deviation
- Find the max price and its day
- Test a threshold
- Your investment plan
- Quit

It also has a main user interaction loop that makes the program user friendly. 

telegraphic transfers are useful for the following reasons:
- Speed: They are usually faster than paper check transfers, and very useful for oversea payments 
- Security: They are a more secure way of sending across money
